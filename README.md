### Inspiration 💡
<hr>
We developed this project to build an immersive and fun way of learning new things through making memories in the social AR and retain the memory and learning for a longer period of time through creative ways! 👨🏼‍🎨

### What it does 🧠
<hr>
As of now we have developed 2 different AR experiences transforming education for kids in a fun and immersive way. 
<br>
1. ARtistic Alphabets: An immersive social AR experience where kids can draw alphabets that are displayed randomly on the screen with the help of their nose, where they can continue playing with the experience, this will also help mobilize the movement of their head. 🔠
<br>
<br>
2. Solar Wond-AR-land: An interactive social AR experience enabling kids to learn and play with solar system in a fun way and that too with friends. Kids can experience this AR with their friends by arranging all the planets in solar system in a sequence or they can simply ask each other to talk about their favorite planet by actually visualising that planet in real world. 👽

### How we built it 🛠️
<hr>
We built these social AR experiences using Meta Spark where we used different capabilities like Target Tracker and Particle system for our two different AR experiences. Along with that we used Blender for modeling and compression as we had a constraint of size for publishing the AR experience on Facebook and Instagram. 

### Challenges we ran into 💪🏼
<hr>
This being our first-ever XR and in-person hackathon, it was a great experience but at the same time we also faced a lot of challenges. One of them being an issue regarding the size limit for uploading the AR experience and we had to compress the 3D models in order to fit in the limits. 

### Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
<hr>
We are super proud that this being our first in-person XR hackathon, we managed to actually develop the social AR experiences and publish them as well despite a few challenges that we faced.
